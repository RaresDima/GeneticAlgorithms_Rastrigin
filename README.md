# GeneticAlgorithms_Rastrigin

A complete genetic algorithm for the rastrigin function, featuring the three most used selection methods:
Roulette Wheel
Rank Based
Tournament
Each of these is featured in a class containing a Main function and can be run independently.

The algorithm runs 100 generations, but the number can easily be modified along with a sample size of 30.

The implementation of the Roulette Wheel also features adaptive parameters for crossover probabilities(a fit individual has a lower chance to be altered trough a genetic operator) along with gray coding for the binary representation of the individuals.
